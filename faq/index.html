		<p class = "question">How much will it cost me?</p>
		<p class = "answer">The instructor fees will be $40 an hour and an average lesson consists of about an hour of ground and an hour of flight training.  The regulations require a minimum of 40 hours of flight experience for the private pilot certificate but most students take closer to 60 hours.</p>  


<p>The average cost for a private pilot certificate are as follows:</p>
<p>60 hrs of flight time  * $115 = $6900
</p>40 hrs of flight instruction * $40 = $1600
<p>40 hrs of ground instruction * $40 = $1600
</p>
<p>Books= $200 </p> 
<P>Maps/Charts = $130
</P>
<p>Written Test Fee = $150
</p>
<p>Checkride Fee = $450
</p>
<p>Medical Exam = $60

<p>Total= $11,290

	<div>
		<p class = "question">Will I make it back alive?</p>
		
		<p class = "answer">No. Almost Definantly not. No one has survived so far, and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.</p>
		<p class = "answer">On the bright side, my planes are really tough, so you don't have to worry about the fact that you are going to crash them!</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<p class = "question">How do I schedule a flight?</p>
		<p class = "answer">The best way to schedule a flight, is to not schedule it, and instead, break in at night, and steal one of the planes. Then you can fly it around for free. Just try to crash it close to the airport, so I can find my plane easily.</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<p class = "question">How do you make money, if everyone dies?</p>
		<p class = "answer">I steal it from the dead people. I take their wallet from the wreckage, and steal their identity, and take all their money from their bank account. In fact, Joshua Monson is not even my real name. It is just the name of one of the people whose identity I stole.</p>

	</div>

	<div>
		<p class = "question">Why do you still use Joshua Monson's name?</p>
		<p class = "answer">It is actually quite interesting. He was my first student, back when I was starting flight training. I had just finished masterminding a coordinated attack, on the pentagon, and the world trade centers. I needed money, and a new identity, so I started this flight school, in order to get some money. My first victim/student was a rather rich fellow named Joshua Monson. Well, I didn't know much about flying, so I just sent him up, to learn it on his own. Minutes later, he crashed, and was killed instantly. I didn't want to arrouse suspicion, so I didn't tell anyone about the death. Instead, I took his wallet, and using his drivers license as reference, I made myself to look like him. He had way more money than I did, so I just started using his credit card. I moved into his house, and when his bills came, I payed them. With his money. He was way better looking than me, so I had plastic surgery, to look like him. I led a pretty exciting life as him. I was funnier, smarter, and better looking than I was when I was just me. I didn't want to go back to being me. Then I fell in love, and got married, as Joshua Monson. I knew I could never go back. And I didn't want to go back. I lived happily for many years. Then, six months ago, my money started running low. I knew I had to do something. So, I started a flight training school.</p>
